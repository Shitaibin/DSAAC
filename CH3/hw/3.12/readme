This problem is to reverse a linked list.

Question a, nonrecursive procedure in O(N) time.
Question b, in O(N) time with constant space.

I do it in head-insertion. No other idead. May be
becasue I have done it many times.

There give a way to nonrecursive. In the first idea
to nonrecursive should be use stack. So, this can be
done with a stack.

If using head-insertion, it will do in O(N) time and
with constant space, and nonrecurive.
