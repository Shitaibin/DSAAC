Just need to add Inject and Eject to normal queue. So, I implement it based on chapter 3.4.

And we also should replace Enqueue and Dequeue with other function name, All depend on the request of the question. 

Push: Insert item X on the front end of deque D.
Pop: Remove the front item from deque D and return it.
Inject: Insert item X on the rear end of deque D. 
Eject: Remove the rear item from deque D and return it.

Each operation take O(1) time.

I just do a little test, and only use Inject and Pop, to simulate a normal queue. More test for you.
