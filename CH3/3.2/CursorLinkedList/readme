How to transmit list.h and list.c to cursor.h and cursor.c?

../LinkedList/ -> .

Solution:

1. cp, and alter the define of PtrToNode, and add some to cursor.h
2. alter cursor.c by using vim string replace cmd, such as:
	%s/p->/CursorSpace[p]./g
	%s/L->/CursorSpace[L]./g
	if you want alter it by typing, it will cost lots of time.
3. alter shell file.
4. alter test.c. just copy it here, then alter the include and just add a line to initialize cursor space.
