# Algorithm

Using preorder traversal. we traverse the trees at the same time.
there are two situation in terms of a node.
situation one: tree1->left equals to tree2->left and tree1->right
equals to tree2->right.
situation two: tree1->left equals to tree2->right and tree1->right
equals to tree2->left.
If not, FALSE.
