# Alogrithm

It use in order traversal, and the thinking of exercise 4.33.
when I filled x and y, it will draw a line here. and then
draw a line with the former point.

# Test

*This function has not been tested*, the key reason is Circle and
DrawLine has not been implemeted. But 4.33 has been tested be right
So, the basic thinking of this algorithm is right.

# Time Complexity

T(N) = O(N).
