# Nature

The nature of child sibling link is using a binary tree to store a normal
tree.

# Traversal Algorithm

- The inorder traversal of a binary tree is traverse children first in a
child sibling link.
- The preorder traversal of a binary tree is traverse parent first in a 
child sibling link.
